    "For this exercise we tried two different approaches. The first calculates multiple similarites for a few users and then multiplies the time this takes to estimate the total runtime. For this method we times the whole process from selecting the users and their data to calculating their similarities. This method would take extremly long, in advance of several years.\n",
    " The other method implemented selects two random users (for computational reasons we only select possible combinations of the first 100 users) and calculates their similarity. The similarity calculation is then timed and multiplied by the total number of possible permutations of user combinations in the dataset. This process is repeated for several random combiations to get a more accurate estimation. With this method the calculation of all possible user pairs would take less than 10 day."
